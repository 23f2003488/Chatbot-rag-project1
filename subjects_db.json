Hence, the task of making good decisions is not easy. The answer is in building quantitative models, and this course is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of this critical, foundational, business skill. The business application of statistical methods is the core focus of this course. In that sense, the course builds on the core course in the first year of the program. That basic course focused on the preliminaries of the area. This course highlights a business application and then demonstates an application of a statistical techique to solve that scenario and arrive at the best decisions and insights.\nby\nProf. Rahul R Marathe\nCourse ID: BSMS2002\nCourse Credits: 4\nCourse Type: Data Science\nPre-requisites:\nBSMS2001 - \u00a0Business Data Management\nWhat you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn\nVIEW COURSE VIDEOS\nAt the end of the this course, the students will be able to apply various statistical techniques to solve various business problems.\nExtrapolate using various techniques and with statistical robustness.\nBuild data-centric business models.\nCourse structure & Assessments\n8 weeks of coursework, weekly online assignments, 2 in-person invigilated quizzes, 1 in-person invigilated end term exam.\n                For details of standard course structure and assessments, visit\nAcademics\npage.\nWEEK 1\nData dashboarding Insights from data summary\nWEEK 2\nCan summarizing the data provide insights?\nWEEK 3\nDo people in different cities prefer different\nbrand?\nWEEK 4\nPredicting the stock returns \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Regression basics\nWEEK 5\nHow do you pay a professor? \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Regression diagnostics - Path variables\nWEEK 6\nCan I cure cancer? \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Logistic Regression - Connection with classification problem\nWEEK 7\nWhat is the impact of repeatedly watching the same ad?
