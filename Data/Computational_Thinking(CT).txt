BSCS1001
Foundational Level Course
Computational Thinking
The students will be introduced to a number of programming concepts using illustrative examples which will be solved almost entirely manually. The manual execution of each solution allows for close inspection of the concepts being discussed.

What youâll learn
VIEW COURSE VIDEOS
Applying a procedural approach to real life problems: sequencing basic steps, identifying common patterns.
Communicating procedural descriptions: flowcharts, pseudo-code.
Understanding underlying abstractions used in programming, through examples: variables, iteration, accumulation, filtering, parametrised procedures, polymorphism and state.
Selecting appropriate data structures to store relationships between data: lists, trees, matrices, graphs.
Identifying algorithmic techniques to solve a given problem: searching, sorting, indexing, matching.
Decomposing problems into smaller units to find a solution: recursion, divide and conquer.
Understanding and checking algorithms: predict their behaviour, design tests to verify their output, perform simple debugging.
