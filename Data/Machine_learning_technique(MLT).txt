I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Data Science and AI department of IIT Madras. Prior to joining IIT Madras, I was a research scientist at the Xerox Research Center (now Conduent Labs), Bangalore for three years. I earned my Ph.D from the Indian Institute of Science where I worked on 'Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons'. My research interests are in the areas of Machine learning, statistical learning theory with applications to education and healthcare.
