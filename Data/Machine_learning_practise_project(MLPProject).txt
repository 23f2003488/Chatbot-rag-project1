Project Course Overview
The MLP Project is conducted on Kaggle platform.
Kaggle is a well recognized platform among data science professionals that will familiarize you with many latest problems being currently solved by organizations across the world.
Good place to practice your ML skills and knowledge. Looks good on your resume, especially if you have won medals and badges.
The project runs for 12 to 15 weeks. The project is divided into several milestones. These milestones divide the ML cycle into smaller and manageable steps. These milestones guide you to make steady progress.
What youâll learn
After completing the project you will gain experience of applying different ML techniques on real world data.
You will gain proficiency in numpy, panda and sklearn libraries.
You will become familiar with the 5 components of any ML project i.e. data, model, cost function, optimization and evaluation, i.e. in short, with complete end to end process of a machine learning project.
In order to successfully complete the project, a viva will be conducted by an industry expert. This viva prepares you for ML interviews.
