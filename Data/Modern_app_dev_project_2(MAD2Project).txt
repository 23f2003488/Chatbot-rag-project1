Modern Application Development II - Project
"Modern Application Development - II project" is an advanced course designed to build upon the foundations of web application development introduced in "Modern Application Development - I." The course focuses on advanced frontend technologies, such as Vue.js, to create interactive and sophisticated user interfaces. It also covers additional concepts like token-based authentication, asynchronous task execution using Celery and Redis, caching, and security considerations.

The course covers some important concepts of web like Token-based Authentication, Asynchronous Task Execution with Celery and Redis, Caching Techniques. The course also talks about Security and Privacy Considerations and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

Project Course Overview
The objective of this course project is to provide learners with hands-on experience in developing advanced web applications using Vue.js and related technologies.
Students will work on building a functional web application that incorporates interactive frontend components, efficient state management using Vuex, token-based authentication for enhanced security, and asynchronous task execution using Celery and Redis.
The project aims to reinforce knowledge gained in "Modern Application Development - I" and introduce advanced concepts in web development.
What youâll learn
Proficiency in advanced frontend technologies such as Vue.js, Vue Router, and Vuex, enabling them to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
Understanding and implementation of token-based authentication for secure user authentication and authorization.
Knowledge and practical experience in using Celery and Redis for asynchronous task execution, improving application performance and scalability.
Familiarity with caching techniques to optimize data retrieval and enhance application efficiency.
Understanding of security and privacy considerations in web development, including handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and ensuring secure user interactions.
